## TweetZiBot ##
----------
A node.js bot that checks search for two Israeli phrases and replay on those tweets

**TweetZiBot** does:

 - Checks for the 3 most used languages on the repo and constructs the *twit* making them #hashtags
 - Watches your repo with the help of the [Github's api](https://developer.github.com/v3/)

**TweetZiBot** doesn't:

 - Hack anything... Or does he? :frowning:
 - Make coffee, unfortunately

To try just:

    git clone https://github.com/ZivKaZiv/TweetZiBot.git && cd TweetZiBot
    npm install
    # Fill the prompted form to share your first TweetZiBot
 And that's it! Deploy to your prefferred provider and Twgitbot will do the rest for you.
